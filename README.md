# Talky-Blocky

A game using voice interactions &amp; React. Built as a demo for the for [Localhost XIII](https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-lightning-talks-february-2020) at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com).

Built with joy & love by [@Driijko](Driijko) and [@georgemandis](http://github.com/georgemandis/) during the Winter 2, 2020 batch.

## How it works

- Hold down the spacebar to talk to Talky-Blocky. It's only listening while the key is being held down. 
- If you say right, left, down or up Talky-Blocky can move around the grid. 
- Say the name of any color and Talky-Blocky can change the grid blocks to that color! 
- You can also say hello and thanks. 

## Tips

- Try to speak clearly so that Talky-Blocky can understand you! Sometime speech recognition can be fickle.
- Don't be afraid to string commands together. Trying saying something like: "**Could you go right for me Talky-Blocky, then go down, go down again, go down one more time, take a left and change that block to pink for me?**"

Unfortunately this requires a [speech recognition API capable browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition), so basically it only works on Chrome right now ðŸ˜”
